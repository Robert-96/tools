# pyregex-utils

`pyregex-utils` provides a collection of utility functions that extend Python's standard `re` module with advanced pattern matching capabilities. The library allows you to:

- Search for patterns within specific text ranges
- Exclude specific ranges from pattern matching
- Search within or exclude matches of other patterns
- Perform replacements with range-based inclusion/exclusion

## Testing

```bash
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
```

Run the test suite:

```bash
pytest
```
